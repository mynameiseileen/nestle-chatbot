- **Azure**: OpenAI Service, AI Search, Web App Service
- **Database**: Neo4j Graph Database

## Known Limitations
My current Azure OpenAI resource is limited to 1,000 tokens per minute. This is quite low as this includes both the input message and the model's output. Due to this, the chatbot will only be able to respond to one question every 1-2 minutes, depending on the message and response complexity. To increase the chatbot's throughput, a quota increase would have to submitted to Azure support. This limitation only applies to my current Azure web deployment.
